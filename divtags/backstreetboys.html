			<h2>Early Years</h2>
			<article>
				<h3>1990–1994: Formation and early years</h3>
				<p>Howie Dorough and AJ McLean were natives of Orlando, Florida, who met each other and later discovered Nick Carter through auditions.[13] The three, realizing that they could harmonize together, decided to form a trio.[13] Cousins Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell, both from Lexington, Kentucky, sang in local church choirs and festivals when they were children.[13] Richardson moved to Orlando in 1990, where he worked at Walt Disney World and concentrated on music at night. Eventually, he met Dorough, Carter, and McLean through a co-worker, and the four decided to form a group.[13]</p>
				<p>In the course of all this, Lou Pearlman in 1992 placed an ad in the Orlando Sentinel to compose a vocal group.[14] McLean, who was the first to audition for Pearlman in his living room, became the group's first member.[14] In January 1993, Pearlman held an open casting call and hundreds of young performers auditioned at his blimp hangar in Kissimmee.[14] Eventually, Carter, Dorough, and Richardson were selected after meeting Pearlman's expectations.[15] Littrell flew from Kentucky to Orlando to formally join the group on April 20, 1993, a day after receiving a phone call from Richardson about it. Thus, April 20 became their anniversary date.[16] Pearlman decided to call them Backstreet Boys, after Orlando's Backstreet Market, an outdoor flea market near International Drive which was also a teen hangout.[14][17]</p>

				<p>The Backstreet Boys had their very first performance at SeaWorld Orlando on May 8, 1993.[18] The group then continued to perform in various venues during summer 1993, from shopping malls, restaurants, to a high-profile charity gala in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[19] With a change in management in the fall, they began to tour schools across the U.S. (including Littrell's former school, Tates Creek High School), building a fan base while trying to get a record deal. Mercury Records nearly signed them in 1993, but the deal fell through at the last minute because longtime Mercury recording artist John Mellencamp threatened to leave the label if they got in boy band business.[20] However, in February 1994, Jeff Fenster (then senior VP A and R Zomba/JIVE Records) and David Renzer (then senior VP/GM of Zomba Music Publishing) caught the group performing at a high school in Cleveland, and signed them to their first record deal.[21]</p>

				<h3>1995–1997: Debut album, worldwide success, and Backstreet's Back</h3>
				<p>In June 1995, the group flew to Sweden to record some songs with Max Martin and Denniz PoP, including "We've Got It Goin' On", which ended up being their very first single. "We've Got It Goin' On" was sent to radio in August 1995 and released as a physical single on September 5, 1995. In North America, Mix 96 in Montreal broke the group after the programmers heard it on the radio in Europe.[22] The song was a minor success in the U.S., peaking at only No. 69 by December 1995,[23] but it entered the top 5 in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, and the Netherlands.[24][25] European success sent them there on a summer tour and shifted their promotion being mostly done in Europe. They finished recording their first album Backstreet Boys in April 1996 and it was released internationally on May 6, 1996,[26] excluding U.S. and Canada; however, it was later released in Canada in October 1996.[27]</p>
				<p>Their popularity grew in Europe. "I'll Never Break Your Heart" reached a Gold status in Germany for selling 250,000 copies[28] and they were voted the No. 1 international group there in 1996. They also earned their first platinum record in Germany in 1996 for selling 500,000 copies of their debut album and shortly thereafter they began touring Asia and Canada.[28] They also became one of the most successful debut artists in the world, collecting awards such as Durchstarter (Best Newcomers) in Germany's Viva Comet Awards in 1996.[29]</p>

				<p>"Anywhere for You" was released as the last single from their international debut album on February 17, 1997.[30] "Quit Playing Games (with My Heart)", which was originally released in Europe as their fourth single in October 1996, was released in the U.S. in May 1997 for their upcoming U.S. debut album. It managed to climb as high as No. 2 on Billboard Hot 100, eventually earning them a platinum-award for selling over one million copies.[31][32]</p>
				<p>The group began working on their second album, Backstreet's Back, in 1996. They also recorded the song "If You Stay" for the Booty 	Call soundtrack in the same year, which was released in February 1997. Backstreet's Back was released internationally (except in the U.S.) on August 11, 1997. Their self-titled U.S. debut album, which consisted of songs from their 1996 international debut album and Backstreet's Back, was released in the U.S. a day later, August 12, 1997.[33] The U.S. self-titled debut peaked at No. 4 on the U.S. album chart and eventually sold 14 million copies.[34] Meanwhile, the second international release, Backstreet's Back, peaked at No. 1 in Germany, Norway, Switzerland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Austria,[35][36] selling well over five million copies in Europe alone.[37] The two self-titled albums, the international debut and the U.S. debut, sold more than 28 million copies worldwide.[38]</p>
				<p>In 1998, Littrell brought a lawsuit against Lou Pearlman and Trans Continental claiming that Pearlman had not been truthful about the earnings made by the group.[39] From 1993 to 1997, Pearlman and his company took about $10 million in revenue while the band only got $300,000.[40] In the following year, McLean, Richardson, and Dorough joined the lawsuit which eventually resulted in a number of settlements.[41]</p>

			<h2>Superstardom</h2>
			<article>
				<h3>1998–1999: Millennium and superstardom</h3>
				<p>In November 1997, doctors discovered that a congenital hole in Littrell's heart had enlarged to dangerous proportions.[42] Littrell postponed the open-heart surgery twice to meet touring obligations, and he finally underwent the surgery on May 8, 1998, in the middle of the Backstreet's Back Tour. The group postponed the tour until July 1998 to give Littrell time to recover.[42]</p>
				<p>On October 7, 1998, the group received the keys to the city from the mayor of Orlando in honor of the tornado relief concert the group headlined in March that raised over $250,000. The day was also declared as Backstreet Boys Day in Orlando.[43] They also began recording their third studio album, Millennium, at the beginning of that month while in the middle of a lawsuit.[44] The worldwide hit single "I Want It That Way" which topped the single-charts in over 25 countries made anticipation for Millennium high.[23][24][45][46] Millennium was released on May 18, 1999, on which day the Backstreet Boys made a heavily publicized appearance on MTV's Total Request Live.[47]</p>
				<img src="images/backstreetalbumpic.jpg" alt="Backstreet Boys Millennium Album Cover" id="pic">
				<p>The album entered the Billboard 200 at No. 1, and managed to sell 1,134,000 copies in its first week of release.[48][49] Four singles were released from Millennium: "I Want It That Way", "Larger than Life", "Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely", and "The One". Millennium became the best-selling album of 1999 in the U.S., selling 9,445,732 copies.[50][51] It also holds the record for most shipments in one year, with 11 million shipment.[52] Millennium remained on the Billboard chart for 93 weeks, eventually selling over 12 million copies in the United States and being certified 13 times platinum.[53][54] As of January 2013, the album stands as the fourth best selling album in the U.S. of the SoundScan era.[55]</p>
				<p>On June 2, 1999, the Backstreet Boys embarked on the Into the Millennium Tour, which comprised 115 sold-out shows in 84 cities, with some additional dates put due to high demand.[56] The second leg, which was sponsored by Sears, was sold out on August 14 on its sale date and broke sales records.[57][58] The concert at Georgia Dome, Atlanta, was the 5th most attended concert in American history and the most attended concert by a pop artist.[59]</p>
				<p>By October 1999, the Backstreet Boys faced new problems declaring their current JIVE contract null and void, soon striking one of the largest record deals ever valued at $60 million with JIVE.[60]</p>

				<h3>2000–2003: Black and Blue, The Hits – Chapter One and hiatus</h3>
				<p>A trip to the Bahamas was made by the group members in May 2000 to write songs for their fourth album.[61] They began recording the album on July 1, 2000 in Stockholm, Sweden, and wrapped up the recording sessions in September.[62][63][64] A song completed during the July recording sessions, "It's True", was released on August 28, 2000 in a compilation album sold exclusively at Burger King restaurants, titled For the Fans.[65]</p>
				<p>The album, Black and Blue, was released on November 21, 2000.[66] To promote its release, they traveled around the world in 100 hours, visiting Stockholm, Tokyo, Sydney, Cape Town, Rio de Janeiro, and New York City. 55 of the hours were spent traveling and 45 were spent making public appearances.[67] A DVD of the short tour, as well as a board game, was released in 2001, titled Around the World. The album itself recorded the best international sales in a week for an album in history by selling over 5 million copies in its first week of sales.[68][69] In the United States, it sold 1.6 million discs in the first week making them the first artist since The Beatles to achieve back-to-back million plus first week sales.[70] Three singles were released from Black and Blue: "Shape of My Heart", "The Call", and "More than That".</p>
				<img src="images/backstreetsuperbowlpic.jpg" alt="Backstreet Boys at the Superbowl">
				<p>On January 28, 2001, the Backstreet Boys performed the American national anthem at the Super Bowl XXXV in Tampa, Florida.[71] A week earlier, the group began the "Black and Blue Tour", which featured shows in five continents. The tour was put on hold in July when it was reported that McLean had entered rehab to battle alcoholism and depression after Richardson held an intervention for him at a Boston hotel.[72] The tour resumed in August and concluded in November.</p>
				<p>Shortly after returning to the Black and Blue Tour, the group faced a harrowing loss with the occurrence of the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks. On the night of September 10, the band had completed a sold-out show in Boston, Massachusetts and the following morning Littrell's wife Leighanne had planned on catching a flight back to Los Angeles aboard American Airlines Flight 11, along with set carpenter Daniel Lee, who was returning home to Los Angeles to see his wife, who was due to give birth to their second child. That night, however, Leighanne cancelled her flight after deciding to spend more time with her husband. Tragically, Lee was among 92 people killed when the hijacked plane was crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.[73] The next day, during a concert on the next leg of their tour in Toronto, Littrell gave a brief speech on Lee and led the audience in a brief moment of silence for Lee and all the victims of the attacks.[74]</p>
				<p>The Hits – Chapter One, their first compilation album, was released on October 23, 2001.[75] It also included a previously unreleased song, "Drowning".[76] The album entered the top 5 in the U.S.,[48] UK,[77] Germany,[35] and Canada,[78] and the top 10 in Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.[79] In the U.S., The Hits: Chapter One was certified platinum for selling over one million copies.[80] It was also certified platinum by IFPI for selling over one million copies in Europe.[81] "Drowning" reached top 10 in many countries and as of 2002, the album had sold almost six million worldwide.[82]</p>
				<p>In 2002, the group expressed a strong desire to leave their management company, The Firm.[82] However, Carter chose to remain with The Firm to manage his solo career. Shortly afterwards, the rest of the group began recording their next album without him.[82] The relationship with JIVE Records worsened when the Backstreet Boys filed a $75–100 million lawsuit against Zomba Music Group (JIVE's parent company), claiming breach of contract.[83] They claimed that the label promoted Carter's solo album Now or Never at the expense of the group.</p>
				<p>In November 2003, McLean appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to talk about his addiction to alcohol and drugs, and his struggles rising to fame for the first time in public.[84] The rest of the group surprised him by appearing in person to give him support, marking the first time the Backstreet Boys had appeared together in public in almost two years.[84] The group began to reform and reconcile their differences, planning to start recording a comeback album at the beginning of the following year.[85]</p>
